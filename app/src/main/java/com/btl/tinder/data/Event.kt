/**
 * A wrapper class for representing one-time events in MVVM architecture.
 *
 * This class is commonly used to handle events that should be consumed only once,
 * such as navigation actions, showing Toast/Snackbar messages, or displaying dialogs.
 * It helps prevent the same event from being re-triggered when the UI is recreated
 * (for example, during configuration changes like screen rotation).
 *
 * @param T The type of the content wrapped inside the event.
 *
 * @property content The actual data of the event (e.g., message, navigation target).
